# Inventory-Optimization

Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze demand-supply mismatch using orders data and inventory data at a Product ID - Year-Month level. The goal is to identify patterns of overstocking and understocking across time and help the warehouse and inventory teams optimize stock levels.

Additionally, the project aims to develop an ABC-XYZ Inventory Segmentation based on:

Sales (Demand)

Demand Variability (measured using Coefficient of Variation)

Profit

This segmentation helps prioritize products that need tighter inventory controls and stocking strategies, especially at the Customer-Market level.
